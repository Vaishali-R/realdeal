	<h1>Purpose of Doing This and Why You Shouldn't Really Care Reading This</h1>
	Like I said, this has been kind of a journey for me, and it will continue to be so because I love learning, since every journey has stops,<br> so I've given the things I've learned the names of the stops I've visited so far:
      <dl>
      	<dt><strong>The Cisco Town</strong></dt>
      	<dd><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/networking-basics">https://www.coursera.org/specializations/networking-basicsCisco networking</a>. There's nothing more exciting in the world than knowing how the Internet works.</dd>
      	<dt>Earth Station</dt>
      	  <dd>If you don't know anything about this wonderful planet you live in, then you're a fool.</dd>
      	<dt>&Pi; Land: Population of </dt>
      	  <dd>One of the most famous numbers in the world of science which I had used extensively without knowing how special it really is. Until now.</dd>
      	<dt>Exo&lpar;tic&rpar; Planets</dt>
      	  <dd>Well, if you're a fool for not knowing about the planet you inhabit then what would you be called if you didn't know<br> that there were other worlds out there too. Same thing I was called. &lpar;ignorant&rpar;</dd>
      	<dt>Silly Valley of Science</dt>
      	  <dd>I used to hate science when I was a kid, but this free time made me wonder why I did so and then eventually its vastness gripped me and made me change my mind.</dd>
      	<dt>Korea Town</dt>
      	  <dd>There's no use of living in this world which is a potpourri of cultures, languages, people, beliefs, etc. if you don't get tempted to try a slice of it.</dd>
      	</dl>
	Now I have to admit that that's the most places I've been to in my entire life, I was just inspired by the famous saying: <q>You're never too old to learn something new</q>-<cite>Vaishali Ramchandran</cite>
	<p>What I'm really trying to say is that there's a whole world out there to be explored and it's not like you have to catch a plane or a train or a spaceship or something to get there.<br> All you have to do is use the Internet in a good way and learn about the world as much as you can, because Google doesn't charge you anything for this ride of a lifetime.</p>
