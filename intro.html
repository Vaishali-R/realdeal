	<p>My name's Vaishali. I just finished my degree and I am still unemployed. Everyone keeps asking me <strong>why??</strong> am I still not employed and quite frankly I have no answer.<br> So I continue doing what I do best, that is, control the urge to punch them in the face and carry on with &quot;my work&quot;.<!--Only thing I can say is that may be I am <em>not</em> &quot;the typical candidate&quot; they are looking for.--></p>
	<p>Ironically, &quot;my work&quot; pretty much involves just sitting in front of my laptop &lpar;my love&rpar; and learning new stuff.<br> It's like a journey for me, discovering new things each day &lpar;wherever the hell they were all this time&rpar;, brainstorming about what to do with what I've learnt<br> and then going to bed with the satisfaction of having learnt something amazing, new and useful.</p>
	<p>That's pretty much how I've been spending my free time and believe it or not, this period makes up for all the four freaking years<br> I spent fooling myself into thinking that I gained some &quot;knowledge&quot;.</p>
	<p>Since I officially have no job, I thought I'd make a website telling people how I officially don't have a job and what I spend my free time doing.<br> Now, this whole website-building business is something of a new skill I recently acquired from a really awesome <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design" title="Course on Web Development">website</a>, I call it &quot;The Webdev Hamlet&quot;.<br> I highly recommend it, if you're upto no good either.<br>So to show the world my usefulness, I have put together all the things I learnt in the Hamlet. And also some of my passtime stuffs. Please visit all the pages and try to enjoy.</p>
